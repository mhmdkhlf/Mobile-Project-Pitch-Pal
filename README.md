## (CSC498X Mobile Development Course Project)

This project is an application that helps in linking the football playersâ€™ community with sports centers owners. Briefly speaking, the website enables football players to form teams, view sports centers near them, invite each other to games, and reserve football fields. Moving to field owners, the application will enable them to add their fields to the system and manipulate (see and edit) the reservations. The players can review the fields they play in. They can also rate other players and teams.

This project is a mobile application.
The mobile application is developed with the Flutter framework.
The backend is developed using MongoDB, Express js, and node.js.
